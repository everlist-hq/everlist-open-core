"""EverList Brain v2 — the assistant behind the chat-first webchat.

Owner call (2026-09-16): the chat must understand the site, navigate it,
and answer questions about it with free phrasing — but it may never INVENT
facts. Architecture (the two-sided law):
- The LLM decides what to do (one JSON action per turn) and writes short
  acknowledgment/meta wording; deterministic code (chatlib) does the doing
  and owns every fact (hub data, prices, escrow states, weather, nav).
- Money moments, declines, identity and greetings stay fixed templates.
- Off-topic is architecturally bounded: the action set is closed, and the
  decline is always the tested template — the LLM can never answer one.

Action protocol (exactly one JSON object per turn):
  {"action": "search|refine|nav|ack|meta|off_topic",
   "say": "<short user-facing line>",
   "q": "<keywords for search/refine>",
   "filters": {"free": bool, "max_price": num, "min_price": num,
               "from": "YYYY-MM-DD", "to": "YYYY-MM-DD", "sort": "price|date"},
   "target": "home|dashboard|results", "refine": bool}

Fail-open law (unchanged from C9): any brain failure (no key, timeout, bad
JSON, executor error) returns None and chatlib falls back to its
  deterministic keyword search — real searches never die with the LLM.
Rate limit: 30 brain calls / 5 min / sender (same law the old router had).
Env: same .secrets/llm.env contract as the retired nlu.py (EVERLIST_*), plus
EVERLIST_BRAIN_MODEL (default qwen3-vl-235b-a22b; probed 2026-09-16: 4/5
mini-eval, ~1.0s avg; mercury/glm-5-3-flash returned empty content).
Stdlib only, like the rest of the chat brain.
