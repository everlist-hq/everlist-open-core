"""C3b: x402 settlement via facilitator for agent-hub-v2.

Settlement = facilitator submits the EIP-3009 authorization on-chain and
returns a tx hash. The hub NEVER custodies funds (no-custody principle);
the facilitator is Coinbase's CDP service (per payments_x402.md).

Design per plan acceptance:
- idempotent: one payment (nonce fingerprint) settles AT MOST once; duplicate
  submissions return the recorded result without calling the facilitator again
- timeout/unknown-outcome: a timeout or 5xx means the settlement state is
  UNKNOWN (never 'settled' without a tx hash); status recorded as 'unknown'
- evidence: settlement results are persisted and reconcilable with the ledger

Production endpoint: CDP x402 facilitator (needs HUB_FACILITATOR_KEY).
Tests override HUB_FACILITATOR_URL with a local stub (documented pattern).
